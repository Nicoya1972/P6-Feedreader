Project Overview
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer 

of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even 

started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own 

company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come 

in.

What did I learn?
I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These 

will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM 

manipulation.
